 It fetch exercises from an api (https://api-ninjas.com/api/exercises)

**Technologies used**
- React: Efficient for building dynamic user interfaces.
- Vite: Fast and efficient development environment.
- ESLint: Maintained code quality
- React Router: Used for navigation and routing.
- React Redux: Managed state to efficiently handle application-wide data.

**challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future**
One of the major challenges was finding a suitable API that provided comprehensive data for the diverse range of workout exercises. Finding an API that encompassed all the necessary information, such as exercise details, categories, img and muscle groups was hard and I neeeded to compromise and use a API without images. In the future I hope to implement more features when filtering and/or a better design on the exercise list.


**Installation Steps**

The starter templet provided a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules, it was provided from Techingo.

1. Cloned the repository from Github
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`


**How to Use the Project**
From the homepage you can explore the different exercises by clicking the button "I am ready" or by clicking the link in the navbar "Exercise List"  

At the Exercise List page you can choose different category with help of the dropdown filter. You can choose for exempel strenght, and then you can filter which musclegroup you want to exercise. Then the page will show you 10 exercises that are provided from the API. You can press the button Exercise details and you will get mor info about how to perform the exercise. 

**What type of problems will your app solve?**
The app addresses the challenge of finding workouts that fit individual needs, making it easier for people to stay motivated and engaged in their fitness journey.

FitnessFusion Workouts also supports the broader goal of improving health and well-being. This matches Agenda 2030 Goal 3, which aims to ensure everyone strive for a healthy life. The app encourages users to enjoy their fitness journey, promoting a balanced and sustainable approach to staying healthy.
